##Goal:

Get people together to create a calculator for the lenght of a trip using the concept of generalized speed from Ivan Illich.

Short explanation of generalized speed:

The generalized speed (also called social speed) is a speed that takes into account the time spent to 'afford' the trip. 

For example if Sharon can use her car to ride 200kms from A to B in 4 hours, her speed is 50km/h.
But taking into account the price of gaz, tolls, parking and other expenses from car ownership this trip costs 40usd.
If her hourly salary is 20usd/hour then it means Sharon has to spend 2 hour working to pay this trip. The generalized speed takes into account both the duration of the trip and the time spent to pay the trip.
The generalized speed of Sharon is thus: 200km / (4h trip duration + 2h time spent to pay for the trip)
= 33km/h

If Sharon prefers to use the train that takes 4 hours for the same distance. Her speed is slower at 40km/h but the ticket only costs 15usd. She only has to work 45 minutes to afford the ticket.
Her generalized speed with the train is consequently: 200km / (5h trip dureation + 45min time spent to pay for the trip)
